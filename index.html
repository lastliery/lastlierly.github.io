                    <p>Writing Skill</p>
                    <p>Writing skills are the skills you use to write effectively and succinctly. My interest in writing is supported by my experience as a secretary.  I have learned many things like Summarizing a meeting in an email for all attendees, Sharing a team update in Slack, Crafting a mass email to send to administrator, Take notes at monthly meetings with other division, Managing the daily agenda and arrange meetings and appointments, Prepare and manage correspondence, reports and documents.</p>

                    <p>Event Management Skill</p>
                    <p>Event management skills are what an event manager or event planner possess in order to run successful events. Event management skills consist of organisational skills, people management, event management, negotiating, budgeting, strategising, creative skills and more. I have quite a lot of experience in designing events, some of the events I have designed are Capacity Building, Management English Day and National Seminar.</p>

                    <p>Programming Skill</p>
                    <p>Programming is the process of designing instructions to be given to a computer.  Coding is the process of changing the ideas in the design into written language (code) that the computer understands or a programming language. I don't have much experience in programming, I can only do basic things.  However, by following the learning process at Infinite Learning, I became interested in exploring programming.</p>
